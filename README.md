Subresource integrity calculator for Middleman

This is a [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) extension to perform [subresource integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) hash computations.

At the present time, this is under heavy development and currently does almost nothing. I suggest that you wait until it is ready before installing or forking it.
